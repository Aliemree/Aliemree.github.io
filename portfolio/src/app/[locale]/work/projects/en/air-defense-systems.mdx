## Project Details

Developed an autonomous air defense turret system that combines state-of-the-art computer vision with precision mechanical control. The system can detect, track, and target aerial objects in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Implemented YOLOv8 for fast and accurate detection of aerial targets.
- **Onboard AI Processing**: Utilized Jetson Nano for edge computing, enabling autonomous operation without external connectivity.
- **Precision Tracking**: Developed servo-based targeting system with smooth tracking algorithms.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized the entire pipeline for minimal detection-to-action delay.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

- **Vision Module**: Camera input processed through YOLOv8 running on Jetson Nano
- **Tracking Algorithm**: Kalman filter-based prediction for smooth target tracking
- **Control System**: PID-controlled servo motors for precise turret movement
