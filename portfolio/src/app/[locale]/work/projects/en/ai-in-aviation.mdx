## Project Details

Developed a real-time AI-based aerial object detection and tracking system for drone applications, capable of operating in day and night conditions.

## Key Features

- **Real-time object detection using YOLOv8**: Fast and accurate detection of aerial objects
- **Small object detection enhanced with SAHI**: Improved detection accuracy for distant or small targets
- **Multi-object tracking with DeepSORT**: Consistent tracking with unique ID assignment
- **Low-light preprocessing for night scenarios**: Enhanced visibility in challenging lighting conditions
- **TensorRT-optimized real-time inference**: Maximum performance through GPU optimization

## System Architecture

The system consists of four integrated components:

- **Vision Module**: Drone camera + YOLOv8
- **Preprocessing**: Low-light enhancement, SAHI slicing
